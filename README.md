# Exchange

Would you reconsider your purchasing decisions if product prices were displayed in units of your favorite things? Do you love the cheeseburger meals from McDonald's? Would you rather have that cool new water bottle or 7 1/2 of micky-d's finest cheeseburger meals? Be reminded of the things that matter most to you when online shopping and (hopefully) reduce your spendings!

Exchange is a chrome extension that allows users to set items of value to them (e.g. a cheeseburger, the chirashi bowl they always get at their favorite sushi place, ...), which replaces monetary values on any webpage to reflect their value in units of those items.
